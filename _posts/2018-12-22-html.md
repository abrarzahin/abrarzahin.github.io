 HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional. The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.


Now lets talk little bit about the history of html. HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.

A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented.  To do this HTML uses two things: tags  and attributes.

# Tags and attributes
Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.

-Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: <h1>.

Most tags must be opened  <h1> and closed </h1> in order to function

-Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.

An example of an attribute is:
{% highlight html %}
 <img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog.">.
 {% endhighlight html %}
 
In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text  (alt) are attributes of the <img> tag.

The way to remember--
The vast majority of tags must be opened (<tag>) and closed (</tag>) with the element information such as a title or text resting between the tags.
When using multiple tags, the tags must be closed in the order in which they were opened. For example:
 {% highlight html %}
<strong><em>This is really important!</em></strong>
HTML Editors
Now that we’ve gotten the basic theory out of the way. It’s time to learn how to build our first website.

First off, we must ensure that we have the right tools. Most important, we need an HTML editor. 
There are many choices on the market such as the extremely popular Notepad++.

However,  we will use the Bluefish Editor as it is free and also offers cross-platform support for Windows, Mac, and Linux users.

If you don't want to install any software, but want to preview code instantly — 
you can use an online HTML editor such as this simple html5 editor.

Do not use Microsoft Word or any other word processor when writing HTML code,
 only an HTML editor or at the very least, your machine’s built-in notepad, is suitable for the task.

Secondly, ensure that you’ve installed a number of different browsers such as Chrome 
and Firefox in order to preview your upcoming creation.

Creating Your First HTML Webpage
First off, you need to open your HTML editor, where you will find a clean white page 
on which to write your code. From there you need to layout your page with the following tags.
 These tags should be placed underneath each other at the top of every HTML page that you create.

<!DOCTYPE html>
This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.
<html>
This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.
<head>
This is where all the meta data for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.
<body>
This is where the content of the page goes.
Inside the <head> tag there is one tag that is always included: <title>, but there are others that are just as important:

<title>
This is where we insert the page name as it will appear at the top of the browser window or tab.
<meta>
This is where information about the document is stored: character encoding, name (page context), description.
Let's try out a basic <head> section:

`<head>`
`<title>My First Webpage</title>`
`<meta charset="UTF-8">`
`<meta name="description" content="This field contains information about your page. It is usually around two sentences long.">`.
`<meta name="author" content="Conor Sheils">
`</header>`
Adding Content
Next, we will make <body> tag.

The HTML <body> is where we add the content which is designed for viewing by human eyes.
 This includes text, images, tables, forms and everything else that we see on the internet each day.

How to Add HTML Headings To Your Web Page
In HTML, headings are written in the following elements:

# * <h1>
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
<h5>
<h6>
As you might have guessed <h1> and <h2> should be used for the most important while the
 remaining tags should be used for sub-headings and less important text. Search engine bots
  use this order when deciphering which information is most important on a page.

Let’s try it out. On a new line in the HTML editor, type:

<h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
 
and hit save. We will save this file as “index.html” in a new folder called “my webpage.”

The Moment of Truth: Click the newly saved file and your first ever web page should open in your 
default browser. It may not be pretty it’s yours… all yours. [Evil laugh]

Well let’s now get carried away, we’ve still got loads of great features that we can add your page.

How To Add Text In HTML
Adding text to our HTML page is simple using an element opened with the tag <p> which creates
 a new paragraph. We place all of our regular text inside the element <p>.

When we write text in HTML, we also have a number of other elements we can use to control 
the text or make it appear in a certain way.

They are as follows:

<b>
Bold text
<strong>
Important text (normally displayed as bold text)
<i>
Italic text
<em>
Emphasized text (normally displayed as italic text)
<mark>
Marked text (normally displayed with a yellow background)
<small>
Small text

<strike>

Striked out text
<del>
Deleted text (normally displayed as striked out)
<u>
Underlined text
<ins>
Inserted text (normally displayed as underlined text)
<sub>
Subscript text
<sup>
Superscript text
These tags must be opened and closed around the text in question.

Let’s try it out. On a new line in the HTML editor, type the following HTML code:

<p>Welcome to <em>my</em> brand new website. This site will be my <strong>new<strong> home on the web.</p>
 
Don’t forget to hit save and then refresh the page in your browser to see the results.

How To Add Links In HTML
As you may have noticed, the internet is made up of lots of links. Almost everything 
you click on while surfing the web is a link takes you to another page within the website
 you are visiting or to an external site.

Links are included in an attribute opened by the <a> tag. This element is the first that 
we’ve met which uses an attribute and so it looks different to previously mentioned tags.

The <a> (or anchor) opening tag is written in the format:

<a href="https://blogging.com/how-to-start-a-blog/">Your Link Text Here </a>
 
The first part of the attribute points to the page that will open once the link is clicked. 
Meanwhile, the second part of the attribute contains the text which will be displayed to a
 visitor in order to entice them to click on that link.

If you are building your own website then you will most likely host all of your pages on 
professional web hosting. In this case, internal links on your website 
will <a href="mylinkedpage.html">Link Title Here </a>.

Let’s try it out. Make a duplicate of the code from your current index.html page. 
Copy / paste it into a new window in your HTML editor. Save this new page as “page2.html”
 and ensure that it is saved in the same folder as your index.html page.

On page2.html add the following code:

<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>
 
This will create a link to Google on page 2.

Hit save and return to your index.html page.

On a new line on index.html add the following code:

<a href="/page2.html">Page2</a>
 
Hit save and preview index.html in your browser.

If everything is correct then you will see a link which will take you to your second page. 
On the second page, there will be a link that will take you to google.com

How To Add Images In HTML To Your Website
In today’s modern digital world, images are everything. The <img> tag has everything you 
need to display images on your site. Much like the <a> anchor element, <img> also contains 
an attribute. The attribute features information for your computer regarding the source, 
height, width and alt text of the image.

You can also define borders and other styles around the image using the class attribute. 
However, we shall cover this in a later tutorial.

The file types generally used for image files online are: .jpg, .png, and (less and less) .gif.

Alt text is important to ensure that your site is ranked correctly on search sites and also 
for visually impaired visitors to your site.

The <img> tag normally is written as follows:

<img src="yourimage.jpg" alt="Describe the image" height="X" width="X">
 
Let’s try it out. Save an image (.jpg, .png, .gif format) of your choice in the same folder
 where you’ve saved index.html and page2.html. Call this image “testpic.jpg.”

On a new line In your HTML editor enter the following code:

<img src="testpic.jpg" alt="This is a test image" height="42" width="42">
 
Hit save and preview the index.html page in your browser.

How To Make an HTML List
In web design, there are 3 different types of lists which you may wish to add to your site.

Ordered List
The first is <ol>: This is an ordered list of contents. For example:

An item
Another item
Another goes here
Inside the <ol> tag we list each item on the list inside <li> </li> tags.

For example:

<ol>
<li>An item </li>
<li>Another item </li>
<li>Another goes here </li>
</ol>
 
Unordered List
The second type of list that you may wish to include is a <ul> unordered list. This is 
better known as a bullet point list and contains no numbers.

An example of this is:

<ul>
<li>This is </li>
<li>An Unordered </li>
<li>List </li>
</ul>
Definition List
Finally, you may wish to include a definition list <dl> on your page. An example of a <dl> list is as follows:

HTML
Hypertext markup language is a programming language used to create web pages, and is rendered by a web browser.
The code used for the above is as follows:

<dl>
<dt>Item</dt>
<dd>The definition goes here</dd>
</dl>
Let’s try it out. Open index.html and on a new line, enter the following HTML:

<p>This website will have the following benefits for my business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased traffic </li>
<li>Global Reach</li>
<li>Promotional Opportunities</li>
</ul>
 
Now hit save and check out the results in your browser. If everything worked out 
then it will display a bullet-pointed table displaying the information above.

How To Add Tables In HTML
Another way to keep your website looking neat and orderly is through the use of a table.
 This is definitely the most complicated part of this tutorial, however,
  studying it will certainly pay off in the long-run.

Important: Do not use a table to layout your website. Search engines hate it and it is
 generally a bad idea. Just…don't. See our CSS tutorial, instead.

With this in mind, tables can still be a useful way to present content on your page.

When drawing a table we must open an element with the <table> opening tag. Inside this
 tag we structure the table using the table rows, <tr>, and cells, <td>.

An example of a HTML table is as follows:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Row 1 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 1 - Colunm 2 </td>
<td>Row 1 - Column 3 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Row 2 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 2 - Column 2</td>
<td>Row 2 - Column 3</td>
</tr>
</table>
 
This will produce a 2-row table with 3 cells in each row.

Tables can get quite complicated, so be sure to check out our special HTML tables tutorial.
 However, watch out for these tags so that you can recognise them and use them as your skills develop:

<thead>
Table head — top of the table
<tbody>
Table body — table content
<tfoot>
Table foot — bottom of the table
<colgroup>
Column group — easy way to organize columns
<th>
Table header — data cell but for the header
Tables, borders, spacing are usually styled using CSS but we will cover this in a later tutorial.

Let’s try it out: Go to a new line on the index.html page within your text editor. Enter the following HTML code:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Row 1 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 1 - Column 2 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Row 2 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 2 - Column 2</td>
</tr>
</table>
 
Hit save and preview it in your browser.


How To Close an HTML Document
You’ve reached the end of our absolute beginners HTML tutorial.

The final step we need to complete is to close the <body> and <html> tags at the end 
of each page using the following HTML code:

</body>
</html>
 
In this guide, you’ve learned how to create basic HTML web pages. You’ve also learned to 
add headings, text, images, links, lists and basic tables to these pages.

You can now use this knowledge to create your own web pages containing these features and 
link them together. We suggest that you further enhance your skills by experimenting with 
the code you’ve learned using different variables. You may also wish to learn about intermediate 
HTML elements or how to make your pages beautiful using CSS.

The power to create your own website is now in your hands.

Troubleshooting
In case things didn’t work out as intended, simply check your HTML code against the examples below:

Most Popular HTML Tags
HTML, which stands for “HyperText Markup Language,” is the coding language for authoring web documents. “Tags” are simply codes that tell a web browser how to display a page. Below are some of the most common tags — used by nearly every website you encounter.

Headings
Headings are a way to make text stand out by breaking up the page.
Paragraph
Paragraphs determine line spacing.
Italics
Create italics text just like in a word processor.
Bold
Bold text emphasizes key words.
Anchor
The anchor tag is most commonly used to create links in combination with the Href attribute.
Unordered List
Unnumbered lists of bullet points use the Unordered List tag.
List Item
Each line on a list is enclosed by a List Item tag.
Blockquote
Blockquote tags are used to enclose quotations from people. This tag helps to differentiate the quote from the text around it.
Horizontal Rule
A horizontal rule is a straight line commonly used for dividing areas of a webpage.
Image
Learn the image tag to find out how to code pictures into your page.
Division
The Division tag defines specific layout styles within CSS.
Most Popular HTML Attributes
What's the difference between a tag and an attribute? Simply put, attributes are a way to customize HTML tags. While a tag is a command in HTML, attributes describe the specifics of how the tag will be customized.

Alt
The Alt attribute for the Img tag indicates replacement text for images that might not load.
Href
The Href attribute specifies the web address called for by an Anchor (or “a”)tag.
Src
The Src attribute specifies the file location of an image.
Style

This site was created to help people learn about web development. While this blog has many posts detailing web development and its components, it's not designed to be a step-by-step tutorial. 

I designed the blog as a teaching tool first and foremost, but it is designed to be simple, clean, and responsive. I used [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/ "html5 boilerplate") as my starting points and narrowed them down to what I considered to be the essentials. The menu is manually generated but is responsive and built on pure CSS. The HTML focuses on semantics and is built with accessibility in mind. The CSS is not based on any framework, and only contains what the blog needs, there are no layout grids or extra UI classes. SASS is used only for code syntax highlighting, and can be stripped out easily as it is imported into the main.css file.

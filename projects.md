# My projects

* Remember-Book
---Built and developed a mobile app using java and xml in Android Studio. Customized the app's styles and themes implementing Google's new Material Design visual language. created the app's data management layer using an SQL live database and two valuable Android patterns, a content provider that gives user a standard interface for creating, reading, updating and deleting notes, and a loader, to manage database calls asynchronously. it allows the user to save the data persistently so that it sticks around between app and device launches. 


* RoomRadi(On process...)

* RoomReservations 
---Built and developed a web application using Java and Spring framework to reserve rooms of hotel. This application not only responds to user input, such as a date selection, but also loads the data based on that user input from the database and dynamically renders it. An Api also  have included in this application that is  capable of serving raw data to another system or another service.

* CORKBOARD Application
---Built and developed a Corkboard web app using react js. The finished product will allow users to create, edit and remove notes in the board. Used JSX to add Xml systex to react js. HTML and CSS were used to style the website and built-in theme.

* SmS-Board Application
---Built and developed a message board web app, with both front-end and back-end components. The finished product will allow one to register new users, log in with an existing user, and log out. Once logged in, users can post new messages, and filter existing messages by user name. Posting messages will be updated in real-time, so that if it's successful, it will show up directly in the message list, but if the server fails for some reason, that can be handled, too, with a notification. The app utilizes both traditional and reactive-based forms in Angular 5, as well as built-in and custom validation. The Angular materials library was used to style the website and built-in theme.

* Master-detail-app
---A simple master detail app with Ionic 3. The application uses an API that returns a list of random people. This is provided by a free API called the Random User Generator. The application begins by calling out to the API, getting the list of people, and then rendering it as a list seen here. When user clicks on a person, a detail page is loaded.  The information shown there comes from the API. There is also a back button. User can easily go back and then select another person as well. All in all it's a simple application.

* Blogger-App
--- A simple Blog application using  Angular 5. Altogether  created two projects where  users can perform CRUD operations. In the  first project, used Google's Firebase along with AngularFire2 to create a real-time chat app fully equipped with the ability to create, read, update, and delete messages.  In the second project, used the MEAN stack to create a simple blog where users can create, read, update, and delete articles.
